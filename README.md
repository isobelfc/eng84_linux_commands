# Linux Commands

- link to check permissions http://permissions-calculator.org/

- check hidden files and directories `ls -a`
- flags - a flag is a type of option of boolean type, that is always false by default and tells the function how to act, e.g. `-a`, `-l`
- what is a wildcard - a character that replaces an unknown character or characters when searching for files
- how to use wildcards
  - `*` represents any number of unknown characters
  - `?` represents one unknown character
  - `[]` matches any characters defined within the brackets
  - e.g. `ls i*` lists any files starting with `i`, `ls *.txt` lists any files of `.txt` type
- how can you do process management 
  - process management is controlling running processes
- what is currently running on your system
  - `top` lists current top processes in real-time
  - `ps` shows a single-moment snapshot of all current processes, and `ps aux` displays more information
- killing a process/crashed processes
  - from the `top` list, you can press `k` to kill a process
  - `kill process_id` also kills processes 
  - `pkill process_name` can kill processes by their name  
- how to check any process running in foreground and background jobs
- how to stop/kill any process running in foreground and background jobs
- how to change permissions with chmod command
  - `chmod +x -w file_name` will grant executable permissions and revoke write permissions
  - `x` for execute, `r` for read, `w` for write
  - permissions can be set for `u` user, `g` group, `o` others or `a` all
  - e.g. `chmod u=rw file_name` gives a user read and write permissions, and removes any additional previously held permissions  
- how to check permission for files/dir
  - `ls -l` lists all files with additional information, including permissions
  - `ll` achieves the same thing
- what does 777, 400, 600 do
  - some combinations of permissions have a numerical shortcut that can be used instead
  - `777` gives rwe to everyone
  - `400` gives r to user and no other permissions
  - `600` gives rw to user and no other permissions
- how to use head, tail, sort, nl (number line), wc (word count)
  - `head [option] filename` displays the first few lines of a file (10 by default)
  - `tail [option] filename` displays the last few lines of a file (10 by default)
  - `sort [options] filename` sorts information
    - the original data is unchanged, the sorted version only appears as command line output
    - by default, it returns each line in alphabetical order, with numbers before letters, and lowercase before uppercase
    - when using the default, numbers will by ordered by first digit, then second e.g. `1, 10, 2`
    - option `-n` sorts numbers according to value e.g. `1, 2, 10`
    - option `-r` reverses the sort order
    - if data is in a table, `-k` will sort by a specific column, e.g. `sort filename.txt -k 2n` 
    - option `-u` returns only unique rows
    - sorted information can be saved into a new file with `sort filename.txt > filename_sorted.txt`
  - `nl` outputs the contents of a file, and includes the number of each line
    - it does not change the original file, but can be saved to a new file
  - `wc` counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file
    - output is in the format `lines words characters filename`
- what is pipping and redirection (hint > indicates to the command line)
- what is STDIN standard input and output
  - `stdin` is standard input stream, which accepts text as input
  - `stdout` is standard output stream, which delivers text to the shell
